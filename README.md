# Employee Performance and Attrition Prediction

# About the Project

This project aims to predict employee attrition using data from an IBM HR dataset. By analyzing various factors such as employee demographics, job role, and work environment, the project utilizes both traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Classfier, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees and deep learning techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to improve prediction accuracy. The insights gained from this analysis can help organizations understand the reasons behind employee turnover and implement strategies to enhance employee retention.

# Project Overview

This project predicts employee attrition using IBM HR data by leveraging traditional machine learning models and deep learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and improve prediction accuracy to aid in retention strategies.

## Introduction

Employees are the foundation of any organization. Committed workers who are driven and effective in achieving the company's aims and objectives are essential to a firm's success.

Thus, employee attrition, the rate at which employees leave their job, hurts the growth and performance of an organization in terms of financial profit, productivity, and time. However, attrition is an inevitable part of any business. There will come a time when an employees wants to leave a company, which can happen for many reasons. For instance, employees might be seeking for better opportunities, mentally illed, working excessive hours, working in a toxic atmosphere or under bad management, etc. But when attrition reaches a particular threshold, it becomes a concern to be addressed as it may be reflecting a deep problem with the company culture. Attrition is particularly concerning when the attrition rate is high, indicating that employees are turning over pretty quickly, or when early attrition rate is high, indicating new joiners leave the company within the first few years of employment. Therefore, it is important to ask questions, find out why people are leaving, and understand what is influencing attrition rate within an organization.

The most important question to ask is what factors are contributing to more employee attrition? Thus, by understanding these reasons for employee attrition, a company can take the correct measures to retain their employees.

To explore these correlations, we used an IBM Employee Attrition dataset to explore and visualize interesting and significant factors that lead to higher employee attrition. We have done this using matplotlib and seaborn.

Further, we have used trained multiple machine learning models like to predict whether an amployee would leave an organisation based on various input columns that cover the factors for employee attrition.

Finally, we have compared the performance of these models using various performance metrics like precision, recall, f1-score, etc.

## Data
For this project, we have used an IBM employee data set hosted on Kaggle that contains various personal and professional information about an employee (i.e. Attrition, Age, Monthly Income, etc). The dataset was last updated in 2017 and does not have any missing data, which makes it easier to work with.
